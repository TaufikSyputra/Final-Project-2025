% Butterworth Bandstop filter designed using FDESIGN.BANDSTOP.

% All frequency values are in Hz.
Fs = 500;  % Sampling Frequency

N   = 4;    % Order
Fc1 = 198;  % First Cutoff Frequency
Fc2 = 202;  % Second Cutoff Frequency

% Construct an FDESIGN object and call its BUTTER method.
h  = fdesign.bandstop('N,F3dB1,F3dB2', N, Fc1, Fc2, Fs);
Hd = design(h, 'butter');
